      What is Your Website About?/What content do you plan to include in each
      page of your website?
    </h1>
    <p>
      My website is going to be about my time studying abroad in Ireland. I was
      thinking one page was going to be about my internship and what i learned.
      I am going to do a page about traveling to galway. I'll make a page about
      the plays I went to. I also will make a page about the courses I took
      while I was there. Another idea i was considering was adding a page about
      pubs I visited.
